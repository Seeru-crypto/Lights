                        <li>The thread loops according to its own logic and if a change occurs, it is broadcast to subscribers via STOMP message</li>
                        <li>Due to the thread logic every light is completely independant from each other. In theory a race condition might occur in UI if a update and DELETE occurs at the same time, but i have not been able to create it.</li>
